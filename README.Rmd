The `{optimizeR}` package 

- provides an object-oriented framework for optimizer functions in R
- and offers some convenience for useRs when minimizing or maximizing.

‚ùå **You won't need the package if you...**

- already know which optimizer you want to use and if you are happy with its constraints (e.g., only minimization over the first function argument possible),
- want to compare optimizers that are already covered by [`{optimx}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optimx) [@optimx] (they provide a framework to compare about 30 optimizers),
- or search for new optimization algorithms (because this package does not implement any optimizer functions itself).

‚úÖ **But you might find the package useful if you want to...**

- compare any optimizer function (also those not covered by `{optimx}` or other frameworks; see the [CRAN Task View: Optimization and Mathematical Programming](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Optimization.html) [@taskview] for an overview of R optimizers),
- have consistently named inputs and outputs across different optimizers (which is generally not the case),
- view optimizers as objects (which can be helpful when implementing packages that depend on optimization),
- use optimizers for both minimization and maximization,
- optimize over more than one function argument,
- measure computation time or set a time limit for long optimization tasks.

## How to use the package?

The following demo is a bit artificial but showcases the package purpose. Let's assume we want to 

- maximize a function over two of its arguments,
- interrupt optimization if it exceeds 10 seconds,
- and compare the performance between the optimizers `stats::nlm` and `pracma::nelder_mead`.

We can easily do this task with `{optimizeR}`:

```{r, load optimizeR}
library("optimizeR")
```

**1. Define the objective function**

Let $f:\mathbb{R}^4\to\mathbb{R}$ with

```{r, ackley}
f <- function(a, b, x, y) {
  a * exp(-0.2 * sqrt(0.5 * (x^2 + y^2))) + exp(0.5 * (cos(2 * pi * x) + cos(2 * pi * y))) - exp(1) - b
}
```

For `a = b = 20`, this is the inverted [Ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function) with a global maximum in `x = y = 0`:

```{r, plot ackley, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
x <- y <- seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100)
grid <- expand.grid(x, y)
z <- mapply(f, x = grid[, 1], y = grid[, 2], a = 20, b = 20)
data <- data.frame(x = grid[, 1], y = grid[, 2], z = z)

library("ggplot2")
ggplot(data = data, aes(x, y, z = z)) +
  geom_contour_filled() +
  theme_minimal()
```

We want to keep `a` and `b` fixed here and optimize over `x` and `y` (which are also both single numeric values).

Two problems would occur if we would optimize `f` with say `stats::nlm` directly: 

1. there are two target arguments (`x` and `y`) and 
2. the position of the target argument is not in the first place. 

Both artifacts are not allowed by `stats::nlm` and most of other available optimizers, but supported by `{optimizeR}`. We just have to define an objective object which we later can pass to the optimizers:

```{r, define objective}
objective <- Objective$new(
  objective = f,         # f is our objective function
  target = c("x", "y"),  # x and y are the target arguments
  npar = c(1, 1),        # the target arguments have both a length of 1
  "a" = 20,              
  "b" = 20               # a and b have fixed values
)
```

**2. Create the optimizer objects**

Now that we have defined the objective function, let's define our optimizer objects. For `stats::nlm`, this is a one-liner:

```{r, define nlm}
nlm <- Optimizer$new(which = "stats::nlm")
```

The `{optimizeR}` package provides a dictionary of optimizers, that can be directly selected via the `which` argument. For an overview of available optimizers, see:

```{r, optimizer dictionary}
optimizer_dictionary
```

Optimizers that are implemented in packages which are not installed yet are only shown here after you install the required packages (for instance using the convenience function `install_optimizer_packages()`).

But in fact any optimizer that is not contained in the dictionary can be put into the `{optimizeR}` framework by setting `which = "custom"` first...

```{r, define nelder mead 1}
nelder_mead <- Optimizer$new(which = "custom")
```

... and using the `$definition()` method next:

```{r, define nelder mead 2}
nelder_mead$definition(
  algorithm = pracma::nelder_mead, # the optimization function
  arg_objective = "fn",            # the argument name for the objective function
  arg_initial = "x0",              # the argument name for the initial values
  out_value = "fmin",              # the element for the optimal function value in the output
  out_parameter = "xmin",          # the element for the optimal parameters in the output
  direction = "min"                # the optimizer minimizes
)
```

**3. Set a time limit**

Each optimizer object has a field called `$seconds` which equals `Inf` by default. You can optionally set a different, single numeric value here to set a time limit in seconds for the optimization:

```{r, set time limit}
nlm$seconds <- 10
nelder_mead$seconds <- 10
```

**4. Maximize the objective function**

Each optimizer object has the two methods `$maximize()` and `$minimize()` for function maximization or minimization, respectively. Both methods require values for the two arguments

1. `objective` (either an objective object as defined above or just a function) and
2. `initial` (an initial parameter vector from where the optimizer should start)

and optionally accepts additional arguments to be passed to the optimizer or the objective function.

```{r, maximize with nlm}
nlm$maximize(objective = objective, initial = c(3, 3))
```

```{r, maximize with nelder mead}
nelder_mead$maximize(objective = objective, initial = c(3, 3))
```

Note that

- the inputs for the objective function and initial parameter values are named consistently across optimizers,

- the output values for the optimal parameter vector and the maximimum function value are also named consistently across optimizers,

- the output contains the initial parameter values and the optimization time in seconds and additionally other optimizer-specific elements,

- `pracma::nelder_mead` outperforms `stats::nlm` here both in terms of optimization time and convergence to the global maximum.

## How to get the access?

You can install the released package version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, install released version, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("optimizeR")
```

Then load the package via `library("optimizeR")` and you should be ready to go.

## Roadmap

The following steps to further improve the package are currently on our agenda:

- [ ] The package already provides a dictionary that stores optimizers together with information about names of their inputs and outputs (see the `optimizer_dictionary` object). We want to extend this dictionary with more optimizers that are commonly used.

- [ ] We want to use alias for optimizers in the dictionary that group optimizers into classes (such as "unconstrained optimization", "constrained Optimization", "direct search", "Newton-type" etc.). This would help to find alternative optimizers for a given task.

- [ ] We want to implement a `$summary()` method for an optimizer object that gives an overview of the optimizer, its arguments, and its properties.
