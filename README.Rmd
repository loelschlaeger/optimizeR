The `{optimizeR}` package provides an object-oriented framework for optimizer functions and offers some convenience when minimizing or maximizing in R.

**You won't need the package if you...**

- already know which optimizer you want to use and if you are happy with its constraints,
- want to compare optimizers that are covered by [`{optimx}`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optimx),
- or search for optimization algorithms (because the package does not implement any optimizer functions itself).

**But you might find the package useful if you want to...**

- compare any optimizer function (already implemented in R or implemented by yourself),
- have consistently named inputs and outputs across different optimizers,
- view optimizers as objects (which can be helpful when implementing packages that depend on optimization),
- use optimizers for both minimization and maximization,
- optimize over more than one function argument,
- measure computation time or set a time limit for long optimization tasks.

The [package vignette](https://loelschlaeger.de/optimizeR/articles/optimizeR.html) has more details on these benefits and how we implemented them.

## Usage

This demonstration is a bit artificial but showcases the package purpose. Assume you want to 

- maximize a function,
- over two of its arguments,
- interrupt optimization if it exceeds 10 seconds,
- and compare the performance between `stats::nlm` and `pracma::nelder_mead`.

This task can very easily be achieved with `{optimizeR}`:

```{r, load optimizeR}
library("optimizeR")
```

**1. Define the objective function**

```{r, ackley}
f <- function(a, b, x, y) {
  a * exp(-0.2 * sqrt(0.5 * (x^2 + y^2))) +
    exp(0.5 * (cos(2 * pi * x) + cos(2 * pi * y))) - exp(1) - b
}
```

For `a = b = 20`, this is the inverted [Ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function). We want to keep `a` and `b` fixed and optimize over `x` and `y`, which are both single numeric values.

```{r, define objective}
objective <- Objective$new(
  objective = f, 
  target = c("x", "y"), 
  npar = c(1, 1), 
  "a" = 20, 
  "b" = 20
)
```

**2. Create the optimizer objects**

```{r, define nlm}
nlm <- Optimizer$new(which = "stats::nlm")
```

Explain custom.

```{r, define nelder mead}
nelder_mead <- Optimizer$new(which = "custom")
nelder_mead$definition(
  algorithm = pracma::nelder_mead, # the optimization function
  arg_objective = "fn",            # the argument name for the objective function
  arg_initial = "x0",              # the argument name for the initial values
  out_value = "fmin",              # the element for the optimal function value in the output
  out_parameter = "xmin",          # the element for the optimal parameters in the output
  direction = "min"                # the optimizer minimizes
)
```

**3. Set a time limit**

Time limit optional. Here it makes no sense.

```{r, set time limit}
nlm$seconds <- 10
nelder_mead$seconds <- 10
```

**4. Maximize the target function**

As for any numerical optimizer, we need initial parameter values, say `r initial <- c(3, 3)`.

Comment on outcome: Note similar structure. But note differences in outcome.

```{r, maximize with nlm}
nlm$maximize(objective, initial)
```

```{r, maximize with nelder mead}
nelder_mead$maximize(objective, initial)
```

## Installation

You can install the released package version from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, install released version, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("optimizeR")
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] The package already provides a dictionary that stores optimizers together with information about names of their inputs and outputs, see the `optimizer_dictionary` object. We want to extend this dictionary with more optimizers that are commonly used.

- [ ] We want to use alias for optimizers in the dictionary that group optimizers into classes (such as "Unconstrained optimization", "Constrained Optimization" etc.). This would help to find alternative optimizers for a given task.

- [ ] We want to implement a `$summary()` method for an optimizer object that gives an overview of the optimizer, its arguments, and its properties.
