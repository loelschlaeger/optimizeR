The {optimizeR} package provides a unified framework for numerical optimizers in R, particularly for their inputs and outputs. 

## What is the problem? 

Look at the popular R optimizers [`nlm()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html) and [`optim()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/optim.html): The function argument in `nlm()` is called `f`, in `optim()` it is `fn`. The argument for the initial values is called `p` in `nlm()`, and `par` in `optim()`. The optimal parameters and the optimal function values in the output of `nlm()` are labeled `estimate` and `minimum`, respectively, in `optim()` it is `par` and `value`. And all is different again with [`pracma::nelder_mead()`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pracma). This inconsistency is painful, especially if one wants to apply and compare different optimizers. 

## Our solution

Simply specify optimizers with `set_optimizer()` and execute them with `apply_optimizer()`. The outputs are in a standardized format.

For demonstration, say we want to minimize the [Ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function)...

```{r, ackley}
f_ackley <- function(x) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x), length(x) == 2)
  -20 * exp(-0.2 * sqrt(0.5 * (x[1]^2 + x[2]^2))) -
    exp(0.5 * (cos(2 * pi * x[1]) + cos(2 * pi * x[2]))) + exp(1) + 20
}
```

... and compare three optimizers: `nlm()`, `optim()`, and `pracma::nelder_mead()`. The first two are already pre-specified...

```{r optimizer1}
library("optimizeR")
optimizer_nlm()
optimizer_optim()
```

... and for the latter (as for any other optimizer) we can use the general constructor:

```{r optimizer2}
optimizer_nelder_mead <- set_optimizer(
    optimizer = pracma::nelder_mead,
    objective = "fn",
    initial = "x0",
    value = "fmin",
    parameter = "xmin"
  )
```

Now we optimize (with initial parameter vector `initial = c(-1,1)`):

```{r optimization}
res <- lapply(
  list(optimizer_nlm(), optimizer_optim(), optimizer_nelder_mead),
  apply_optimizer, 
  objective = f_ackley, 
  initial = c(-1,1)
)
names(res) <- c("nlm", "optim", "nelder_mead")
```

In the optimization results, `value` and `parameter` consistently denote the optimal function values and the optimal parameters, while optimizer-specific outputs are preserved. The optimization time in seconds, `seconds` is automatically added.

```{r result}
str(res)
```

P.S. Surprised that the `optim` result differs from the others? It seems that this optimizer got stuck in a local minimum. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of {optimizeR} from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

install.packages("optimizeR")
```

...and the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("loelschlaeger/optimizeR")
```
