The {optimizeR} package reverse depends on two packages called {ino} and {ao}. I am the maintainer of all three.

The problems found when checking the first order strong reverse dependencies are expected. I do not need to fix anything in the {optimizeR} package. However, I will adapt both {ino} and {ao} to the new {optimizeR} version.
